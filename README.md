Code for the research work on the *predictive analysis and modeling of disease classes using genetic data.*


**_Abstract_** ​:
Using machine learning approaches to develop a method that uses genetic microarray data to
predict disease classes. This study aims to evaluate different machine learning techniques in
prediction of disease.
The dataset is extracted from a DNA microarray which measures the expression levels of large
numbers of genes simultaneously. Samples in the datasets represent patients; for each patient
7070 genes expressions (values) are measured in order to classify the patient’s disease into one
of the following cases: EPD, JPA, MED, MGL, RHB.
**_Keywords—_** ​ ​disease prediction; Machine Learning Algorithm; genetic microarray.
